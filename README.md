i implemented a simplified C-Abstractor model to test its locality-preserving projection, using a synthetic 14x14 input compressed to 7x7.
also visualized heatmaps to confirm localized activation retention and quantified center vs. edge activation; highlighting its strength in spatial multimodal tasks.
## 2
built a basic Vision Transformer with PnP, handling variable-resolution inputs by packing patches and using masked attention. 
+ token dropping and resolution sampling, visualized input heatmaps and output norms across configurations, and demonstrated the cost-performance trade-off with a line plot.
